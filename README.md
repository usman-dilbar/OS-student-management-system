## About the Project

The **OS Student Management System** is a command-line application designed to help manage student records efficiently. This program demonstrates the power of Shell scripting in handling tasks such as managing files and user input, and performing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

The project is tailored for educational purposes and provides an opportunity for learners to understand how to:
- Use Shell scripting for file manipulation.
- Implement user interaction in a terminal-based environment.
- Develop a clear flow for operations using command-line utilities.

## Features

- **Add Student Records**: Add new student information such as name, ID, and other details.
- **View Records**: Display all student records in a readable format.
- **Update Records**: Modify existing student data.
- **Delete Records**: Remove a student record from the system.
- **Search Records**: Quickly find a specific student using their ID or name.

These features make it easier to manage student information directly through the command line without the need for a database system.
